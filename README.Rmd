# TSAIB

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of TSAIB is to estimate a model based on time series analysis, and 
account for intermission bias of satellite observations.
Input file type: NetCDF (Network Common Data Form).

## Installation

You can install the development version of TSAIB like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```
## Data set used for demonstration of the TSAIB package:
``` r 
TSdata
#?TSdata
# Description
#  An extracted list using the "GridTSExtract" function, from the data set:
#  Rose, S.K.; Andersen, O.B.; Passaro, M.; Ludwigsen, C.A.; Schwatke, 
#  C. Arctic Ocean Sea Level Record from the Complete Radar 
#  Altimetry Era: 1991ï¿½2018. Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1672. 
#  https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/14/1672"
# Usage
#  TSdata
# Format
#  A large list containing 5 elements, which are:
#  longitude: containing longitudes from -180:180, by increments of 0.5 degrees (length: 720)
#  latitude: containing latitudes from 65:81.5, by increments of 0.25 degrees (length: 67)
#  date: containing years from 1991:2019, by increments of 1/12 (length:325)
#  measurements: containing sea_level_anomaly measurements for each increments of: 
#  longitude, latitude and date. (dimension: [67,720,325])
#  TSmatrix: containing a 3x3x325 grid of measurements centered around (lon,lat)=(-165,74)

# Arguments
#  nco: The NetCDF object (open with "nc_open" from the "ncdf4" library)
#  lonid: The variable id for longitude vector. e.g.: "longitude"
#  latid: The variable id for latitude vector. e.g.: "latitude"
#  timeid: The variable id for the time vector. e.g.: "date"
#  measurementsid: The variable id for the measurements vector. e.g.: "sea_level_anomaly"
#  coord: The center coordinate for the TS grid area. e.g.: c(lon,lat) i.e. c(-164,74)
#  radius: The square radius of the TS grid. e.g: 0=1x1 grid, 1=3x3 grid, 2=5x5 grid etc.
#  dlon: Number of data points for each degree longitude
#  dlat:Number of data points for each degree latitude
```
``` r 
TSdiagnostics
#?TSdiagnostics
# Description
#  Shows basic statistics and characteristics of the time series data
# Usage
#  TSdiagnostics(TS, nanrem = "FALSE")
# Arguments
#  TS:The time series to be analyzed
#  nanrem: Set NaN to be removed or not. e.g.: nanrem="TRUE"
``` 
``` r 
TSnanrem
#?TSnanrem
# Description
#  Removes or imputes NaN from the time series data set, with a specified method of choice
# Usage
#  TSnanrem(TS, method = "mean", value_nr = 0)
# Arguments
#  TS: The time series to remove NaN from
#  method: The imputation method. e.g.: "omit", "mean", "median" or "value"
#  value_nr: The specific value for the "value" imputing method. e.g.: value_nr=0

``` 
``` r 
TSAplots
#?TSAplots
# Description
#  Plots and saves the ACF and PACF for a pre-defined time series, with and without data 
#  transformations (log, sqrt), and differencing. Input type: Time series
# Usage
#  TSAplots(TS, date, trans = "NONE", saveas = "NONE")
# Arguments
#  TS: The time series for the TSAplots function
#  date: The time axis in the time series (dates, seconds, intervals)
#  trans: data transform parameter: trans='log' for log transform, trans='sqrt' for sqrt 
#  transform, and trans='NONE' for no transform
#  saveas: specifies the file format to save the plots in the current working directory. Possible
#  formats is: PDF, JPEG, TIFF, BMP and PNG. e.g.: "pdf" or "jpeg". If none is specified, it will
#  not save the plots
``` 
``` r 
ARIMAbuilder
#?ARIMAbuilder
# Description
#  Lists the top 5 estimated ARIMA/SARIMA models of the form: ARIMA(p,d,q)x(P,D,Q), based on 
#  specified parameter values and ranges
# Usage
#  ARIMAbuilder(TS, p = 1, d = 1, q = 1, P = 1, D = 1, Q = 1, S = 12)
# Arguments
#  TS: The time series to build the models upon (remember to transform before using this function!)
#  p: The maximum AR value, estimated from plot analysis
#  d: The fixed differencing, often 0, 1 or 2
#  q:	The maximum MA value, estimated from plot analysis
#  P:	The maximum seasonal AR value, estimated from plot analysis
#  D:	The fixed seasonal differencing, often 0, 1 or 2
#  Q:	The mazimum seasonal MA value, estimated from plot analysis
#  S:	The seasonality/period of the seasonal differencing
``` 



## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TSAIB)
## Initially extract the wanted time series data from your NetCDF object (nco) using GridTSExtract:

#TSdata=GridTSExtract(nco,"longitude","latitude","date","sea_level_anomaly",c(-165,74),1,2,4)

## TSdiagnostics can be used to gather simple statistics about the data
TSdiagnostics(TSdata$TSmatrix,nanrem="TRUE") #analyze extracted dataset, and remove NaN

## Based on the output from TSdiagnostics, NaNs may be dealt with using TSnanrem:
TS_default=TSnanrem(TSdata$TSmatrix[3,3,])# replaces NaN by mean, as default

## With the NaN's taken care of, a set of time series analysis plots is made with TSAplots
TSAplots(TS_default,TSdata$date)

## Based on the TSA plots, an Arima(p,d,q)x(P,D,Q) model can be estimated
MODELS=ARIMAbuilder(TSdata$TSmatrix[2,2,],2,1,3,1,1,2,12)
print(MODELS)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
